### Getting started

Download the GloVe vectors with

```
make glove
```
Alternatively, you can download them manually [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and update the `glove_filename` entry in `config.py`. You can also choose not to load pretrained word vectors by changing the entry `use_pretrained` to `False` in `model/config.py`.
